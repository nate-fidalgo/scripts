This script is so cool it allows one to create a text file  like this and it batch process into svg imgs your math expressions

Now you can easily take your svg files and the printed out imgs tags and embed them in a webpage just by upload/copy paste.
No mathml required and since they are in svg format they dont loose quality like a raster image. You can zoom in/out wont change quality.
Also equally important is svg are very small size compared to raster images so there not bloaty for websites.

Dont get me wrong mathml is great option to if you have a good editor for it and your browser supports it which most do now.

But svg images is the tried and true way most site website would do it. Other benifits is it is supported by all browsers that support img tags 
with svg sources.
